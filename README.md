Bayesian pragmatic models in Python
==========

## Models

* The basic Rational Speech Acts model of Frank and Goodman 2012
* The lexical uncertainty model of Bergen et al. 2012
* The anxiety/uncertianty model of Smith et al. 2013
* The anxious experts model of Levy and Potts 2015

To see these models are work on an example involving the division of
pragmatic labor, run

`python pragmods.py`

which runs the main method example given in full at the bottom of
the file.
